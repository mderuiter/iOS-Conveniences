# Ignores

On GitHub there is an [repository](https://github.com/github/gitignore) full with all kind of gitignore files. This repo contains gitignore files for iOS related projects. 

## Usage

Create a gitignore file in your project directory. Make sure the name is equal to .gitignore.
Next, you add all files or directories you would not like expose to git. 
For inspiration of what you would like to add to git and what you would preferably not add to git, you can checkout some [examples](https://github.com/mderuiter/iOS-Conveniences/tree/master/Ignores/Examples).
