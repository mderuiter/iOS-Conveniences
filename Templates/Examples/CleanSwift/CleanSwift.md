# CleanSwift templates

CleanSwift is an architecture that contains a lot of files, so it is nice to have this as a example for using templates.

The templates are not mine, but are downloaded from a [Medium post](https://medium.com/swift2go/installing-the-clean-swift-template-in-xcode-6b4367006827) from Dejan Atanasov.
